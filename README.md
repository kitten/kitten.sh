# [kitten.sh](https://kitten.sh)

My editorial site for some of my essays and write ups.
If this looks like a publication that is because maybe in the future
this will be well suited to guest host other people's posts.<br />
Driven by:

- [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/)
- [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx)
- [next-mdx-enhanced](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced)
- [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact)
- [Goober](https://github.com/cristianbote/goober)
- some misc. packages.

To start up this site locally run: `yarn` and `yarn dev`.
